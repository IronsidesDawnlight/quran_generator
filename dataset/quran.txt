In the Name of God the Compassionate the Merciful
RECITE thou in the name of thy Lord who created 
Created man from CLOTS OF BLOOD
Recite thou For thy Lord is the most Beneficent
Who hath taught the use of the pen
Hath taught Man that which he knoweth not
Nay verily Man is insolent
Because he seeth himself possessed of riches
Verily to thy Lord is the return of all
What thinkest thou of him that holdeth back
A servant of God when he prayeth
What thinkest thou Hath he followed the true Guidance or enjoined Piety
What thinkest thou Hath he treated the truth as a lie and turned his back
What doth he not know how that God seeth
Nay verily if he desist not We shall seize him by the forelock
The lying sinful forelock
Then let him summon his associates
We too will summon the guards of Hell
Nay obey him not but adore and draw nigh to God
In the Name of God the Compassionate the Merciful
O THOU ENWRAPPED in thy mantle
Arise and warn
Thy Lord magnify Him
Thy raiment purify it
The abomination flee it
And bestow not favours that thou mayest receive again with increase
And for thy Lord wait thou patiently
For when there shall be a trump on the trumpet
That shall be a distressful day
A day to the Infidels devoid of ease
Leave me alone to deal with him whom I have created
And on whom I have bestowed vast riches
And sons dwelling before him
And for whom I have smoothed all things smoothly down 
Yet desireth he that I should add more
But no  because to our signs he is a foe
I will lay grievous woes upon him
For he plotted and he planned
May he be cursed  How he planned
Again may he be cursed  How he planned
Then looked he around him
Then frowned and scowled
Then turned his back and swelled with disdain
And said “This is merely magic that will be wrought
It is merely the word of a mortal”
We will surely cast him into Hell fire
And who shall teach thee what Hell fire is
It leaveth nought it spareth nought
Blackening the skin
Over it are nineteen angels
None but angels have we made guardians of the fire nor have we made this to be their number but to perplex the unbelievers and that they who possess the Scriptures may be certain of the truth of the Koran and that they who believe may increase their faith
And that they to whom the Scriptures have been given and the believers may not doubt
And that the infirm of heart and the unbelievers may say What meaneth God by this parable
Thus God misleadeth whom He will and whom He will doth He guide aright and none knoweth the armies of thy Lord but Himself and this is no other than a warning to mankind
Nay by the Moon
By the Night when it retreateth
By the Morn when it brighteneth
Hell is one of the most grievous woes
Fraught with warning to man
To him among you who desireth to press forward or to remain behind
For its own works lieth every soul in pledge  But they of God’s right hand
In their gardens shall ask of the wicked 
“What hath cast you into Hell fire”
They will say “We were not of those who prayed
And we were not of those who fed the poor
And we plunged into vain disputes with vain disputers
And we rejected as a lie the day of reckoning
Till the certainty came upon us”
And intercession of the interceders shall not avail them
Then what hath come to them that they turn aside from the Warning
As if they were affrighted asses fleeing from a lion
And every one of them would fain have open pages given to him out of Heaven
It shall not be  They fear not the life to come
It shall not be  For this Koran is warning enough  And whoso will it warneth him
But not unless God please shall they be warned  
Meet is He to be feared
Meet is forgiveness in Him
In the Name of God the Compassionate the Merciful
O THOU ENFOLDED in thy mantle
Stand up all night except a small portion of it for prayer
Half or curtail the half a little 
Or add to it And with measured tone intone the Koran
For we shall devolve on thee weighty words
Verily at the oncoming of night are devout impressions strongest and words are most collected
But in the day time thou hast continual employ 
And commemorate the name of thy Lord and devote thyself to Him with entire devotion
Lord of the East and of the West No God is there but He Take Him for thy protector
And endure what they say with patience and depart from them with a decorous departure
And let Me alone with the gainsayers rich in the pleasures of this life and bear thou with them yet a little while
For with Us are strong fetters and a flaming fire
And food that choketh and a sore torment
The day cometh when the earth and the mountains shall be shaken and the mountains shall become a loose sand heap
Verily we have sent you an Apostle to witness against you even as we sent an Apostle to Pharaoh
But Pharaoh rebelled against the Apostle and we therefore laid hold on him with a severe chastisement
And how if ye believe not will you screen yourselves from the day that shall turn children greyheaded
The very heaven shall be reft asunder by it this threat shall be carried into effect
Lo this is a warning Let him then who will take the way to his Lord 
Of a truth thy Lord knoweth that thou prayest almost two thirds or half or a third of the night as do a part of thy followers 
But God measureth the night and the day  
He knoweth that ye cannot count its hours aright and therefore turneth to you mercifully 
Recite then so much of the Koran as may be easy to you 
He knoweth that there will be some among you sick while others travel through the earth in quest of the bounties of God and others do battle in his cause 
Recite therefore so much of it as may be easy And observe the Prayers and pay the legal Alms
and lend God a liberal loan for whatever good works ye send on before for your own behoof ye shall find with God 
This will be best and richest in the recompense 
And seek the forgiveness of God verily God is forgiving Merciful
In the Name of God the Compassionate the Merciful
BY the noon day BRIGHTNESS
And by the night when it darkeneth
Thy Lord hath not forsaken thee neither hath he been displeased
And surely the Future shall be better for thee than the Past
And in the end shall thy Lord be bounteous to thee and thou be satisfied
Did he not find thee an orphan and gave thee a home
And found thee erring and guided thee
And found thee needy and enriched thee
As to the orphan therefore wrong him not
And as to him that asketh of thee chide him not away
And as for the favours of thy Lord tell them abroad
In the Name of God the Compassionate the Merciful
HAVE we not OPENED thine heart for thee
And taken off from thee thy burden
Which galled thy back
And have we not raised thy name for thee
Then verily along with trouble cometh ease
Verily along with trouble cometh ease
But when thou art set at liberty then prosecute thy toil
And seek thy Lord with fervour
In the Name of God the Compassionate the Merciful
SAY I betake me for refuge to the Lord of the DAY BREAK
Against the mischiefs of his creation
And against the mischief of the night when it overtaketh me
And against the mischief of weird women
And against the mischief of the envier when he envieth
In the Name of God the Compassionate the Merciful
SAY I betake me for refuge to the Lord of MEN
The King of men
The God of men
Against the mischief of the stealthily withdrawing whisperer
Who whispereth in man's breast 
Against djinn and men
In the Name of God the Compassionate the Merciful
PRAISE be to God Lord of the worlds
The compassionate the merciful
King on the day of reckoning
Thee only do we worship and to Thee do we cry for help
Guide Thou us on the straight path
The path of those to whom Thou hast been gracious with whom thou art not angry and who go not astray
In the Name of God the Compassionate the Merciful
SAY O ye UNBELIEVERS
I worship not that which ye worship
And ye do not worship that which I worship
I shall never worship that which ye worship
Neither will ye worship that which I worship
To you be your religion to me my religion
In the Name of God the Compassionate the Merciful
SAY He is God alone
God the eternal
He begetteth not and He is not begotten
And there is none like unto Him
In the Name of God the Compassionate the Merciful
Let the hands of ABU LAHAB perishand let himself perish
His wealth and his gains shall avail him not
Burned shall he be at the fiery flame
And his wife laden with fire wood
On her neck a rope of palm fibre
In the Name of God the Compassionate the Merciful
TRULY we have given thee an ABUNDANCE
Pray therefore to the Lord and slay the victims
Verily whoso hateth thee shall be childless
In the Name of God the Compassionate the Merciful
Woe to every BACKBITER Defamer
Who amasseth wealth and storeth it against the future
He thinketh surely that his wealth shall be with him for ever
Nay for verily he shall be flung into the Crushing Fire
And who shall teach thee what the Crushing Fire is
It is God's kindled fire
Which shall mount above the hearts of the damned
It shall verily rise over them like a vault
On outstretched columns
In the name of God the Compassionate the Merciful
WHAT thinkest thou of him who treateth our RELIGION as a lie
He it is who trusteth away the orphan
And stirreth not others up to feed the poor
Woe to those who pray
But in their prayer are careless
Who make a shew of devotion
But refuse help to the needy
In the name of God the Compassionate the Merciful
THE DESIRE of increasing riches occupieth you
Till ye come to the grave
Nay but in the end ye shall know
Nay once morein the end ye shall know your folly
Nay would that ye knew it with knowledge of certainty
Surely ye shall see hell fire
Then shall ye surely see it with the eye of certainty
Then shall ye on that day be taken to task concerning pleasures
In the name of God the Compassionate the Merciful
BY the NIGHT when she spreads her veil
By the Day when it brightly shineth
By Him who made male and female
At different ends truly do ye aim
But as to him who giveth alms and feareth God
And yieldeth assent to the Good
To him will we make easy the path to happiness
But as to him who is covetous and bent on riches
And calleth the Good a lie
To him will we make easy the path to misery
And what shall his wealth avail him when he goeth down
Truly man’s guidance is with Us
And Our’s the Future and the Past
I warn you therefore of the flaming fire
None shall be cast to it but the most wretched
Who hath called the truth a lie and turned his back
But the God fearing shall escape it
Who giveth away his substance that he may become pure
And who offereth not favours to any one for the sake of recompense
But only as seeking the face of his Lord the Most High
And surely in the end he shall be well content
In the Name of God the Compassionate the Merciful
Nun By the PEN and by what they write
Thou O Prophet by the grace of thy Lord art not possessed
And truly a boundless recompense doth await thee
For thou art of a noble nature
But thou shalt see and they shall see Which of you is the demented
Now thy Lord well knoweth He the man who erreth from his path and well doth he know those who have yielded to Guidance
Give not place therefore to those who treat thee as a liar
They desire thee to deal smoothly with them then would they be smooth as oil with thee
But yield not to the man of oaths a despicable person
Defamer going about with slander
Hinderer of the good transgressor criminal
Harsh beside this impure by birth
Though a man of riches and blessed with sons
Who when our wondrous verses are recited to him saith Fables of the ancients
We will brand him on the nostrils
Verily we have proved them  the Meccans  as we proved the owners of the garden when they swore that at morn they would cut its fruits
But added no reserve
Wherefore an encircling desolation from thy Lord swept round it while they slumbered
And in the morning it was like a garden whose fruits had all been cut
Then at dawn they called to each other
Go out early to your field if ye would cut your dates
So on they went whispering to each other
No poor man shall set foot this day within your garden
And they went out at daybreak with this settled purpose
But when they beheld it they said Truly we have been in fault
Yes we are forbidden our fruits
The most rightminded of them said Did I not say to you Will ye not give praise to God
They said Glory to our Lord Truly we have done amiss
And they fell to blaming one another
They said Oh woe to us we have indeed transgressed
Haply our Lord will give us in exchange a better garden than this verily we
crave it of our Lord
Such hath been our chastisement but heavier shall be the chastisement of the next world Ah did they but know it
Verily for the God fearing are gardens of delight in the presence of their Lord
Shall we then deal with those who have surrendered themselves to God as with those who offend him
What hath befallen you that ye thus judge
Have ye a Scripture wherein ye can search out
That ye shall have the things ye choose
Or have ye received oaths which shall bind Us even until the day of the resurrection that ye shall have what yourselves judge right
Ask them which of them will guarantee this
Or is it that they have joined gods with God let them produce those associate gods of theirs if they speak truth
On the day when men's legs shall be bared and they shall be called upon to bow in adoration they shall not be able
Their looks shall be downcast shame shall cover them because while yet in safety they were invited to bow in worship but would not obey
Leave me alone therefore with him who chargeth this revelation with imposture 
We will lead them by degrees to their ruin by ways which they know not
Yet will I bear long with them for my plan is sure
Askest thou any recompense from them But they are burdened with debt
Are the secret things within their ken Do they copy them from the Book of God
Patiently then await the judgment of thy Lord and be not like him who was in the fish when in deep distress he cried to God
Had not favour from his Lord reached him cast forth would he have been on the naked shore overwhelmed with shame
But his Lord chose him and made him of the just
Almost would the infidels strike thee down with their very looks when they hear the warning of the Koran And they say He is certainly possessed
Yet is it nothing less than a warning for all creatures
In the Name of God the Compassionate the Merciful
I NEED not to swear by this SOIL
This soil on which thou dost dwell
Or by sire and offspring
Surely in trouble have we created man
What thinketh he that no one hath power over him
I have wasted saith he enormous riches
What thinketh he that no one regardeth him
What have we not made him eyes
And tongue and lips
And guided him to the two highways
Yet he attempted not the steep
And who shall teach thee what the steep is
It is to ransom the captive
Or to feed in the day of famine
The orphan who is near of kin or the poor that lieth in the dust
Beside this to be of those who believe and enjoin stedfastness on each other and enjoin compassion on each other
These shall be the people of the right hand
While they who disbelieve our signs
Shall be the people of the left
Around them the fire shall close
In the Name of God the Compassionate the Merciful
HAST thou not seen how thy Lord dealt with the army of the ELEPHANT
Did he not cause their stratagem to miscarry
And he sent against them birds in flocks  ababils 
Claystones did they hurl down upon them
And he made them like stubble eaten down
In the Name of God the Compassionate the Merciful
For the union of the KOREISCH
Their union in equipping caravans winter and summer
And let them worship the Lord of this house who hath provided them with food against hunger
And secured them against alarm
In the Name of God the Compassionate the Merciful
VERILY we have caused It to descend on the night of POWER
And who shall teach thee what the night of power is
The night of power excelleth a thousand months
Therein descend the angels and the spirit by permission of their Lord for every matter
And all is peace till the breaking of the morn
In the Name of God the Compassionate the Merciful
BY the heaven and by the NIGHT COMER
But who shall teach thee what the night comer is
'Tis the star of piercing radiance
Over every soul is set a guardian
Let man then reflect out of what he was created
He was created of the poured forth germs
Which issue from the loins and breastbones
Well able then is God to restore him to life 
On the day when all secrets shall be searched out
And he shall have no other might or helper
I swear by the heaven which accomplisheth its cycle
And by the earth which openeth her bosom
That this Koran is a discriminating discourse
And that it is not frivolous
They plot a plot against thee
And I will plot a plot against them
Deal calmly therefore with the infidels leave them awhile alone
In the Name of God the Compassionate the Merciful
BY the SUN and his noonday brightness
By the Moon when she followeth him
By the Day when it revealeth his glory
By the Night when it enshroudeth him
By the Heaven and Him who built it
By the Earth and Him who spread it forth
By a Soul and Him who balanced it
And breathed into it its wickedness and its piety
Blessed now is he who hath kept it pure
And undone is he who hath corrupted it
Themoud in his impiety rejected the message of the Lord
When the greatest wretch among them rushed up 
Said the Apostle of God to them The Camel of God let her drink
But they treated him as an impostor and hamstrung her
So their Lord destroyed them for their crime and visited all alike
Nor feared he the issue
In the Name of God the Compassionate the Merciful
HE FROWNED and he turned his back
Because the blind man came to him
But what assured thee that he would not be cleansed by the Faith
Or be warned and the warning profit him
As to him who is wealthy 
To him thou wast all attention
Yet is it not thy concern if he be not cleansed
But as to him who cometh to thee in earnest
And full of fears 
Him dost thou neglect
Nay but it  the Koran  is a warning
 And whoso is willing beareth it in mind 
Written on honoured pages
Exalted purified
By the hands of Scribes honoured righteous
Cursed be man What hath made him unbelieving
Of what thing did God create him
Out of moist germs
He created him and fashioned him
Then made him an easy passage from the womb
Then causeth him to die and burieth him
Then when he pleaseth will raise him again to life
Aye but man hath not yet fulfilled the bidding of his Lord
Let man look at his food
It was We who rained down the copious rains
Then cleft the earth with clefts
And caused the upgrowth of the grain
And grapes and healing herbs
And the olive and the palm
And enclosed gardens thick with trees
And fruits and herbage
For the service of yourselves and of your cattle
But when the stunning trumpet blast shall arrive
On that day shall a man fly from his brother
And his mother and his father
And his wife and his children
For every man of them on that day his own concerns shall be enough
There shall be faces on that day radiant
Laughing and joyous
And faces on that day with dust upon them
Blackness shall cover them
These are the Infidels the Impure
In the Name of God the Compassionate the Merciful
PRAISE the name of thy Lord THE MOST HIGH
Who hath created and balanced all things
Who hath fixed their destinies and guideth them
Who bringeth forth the pasture
And reduceth it to dusky stubble
We will teach thee to recite the Koran nor aught shalt thou forget
Save what God pleaseth for he knoweth alike things manifest and hidden
And we will make easy to thee our easy ways
Warn therefore for the warning is profitable
He that feareth God will receive the warning 
And the most reprobate only will turn aside from it
Who shall be exposed to the terrible fire
In which he shall not die and shall not live
Happy he who is purified by Islam
And who remembereth the name of his Lord and prayeth
But ye prefer this present life
Though the life to come is better and more enduring
This truly is in the Books of old
The Books of Abraham and Moses
In the Name of God the Compassionate the Merciful
I SWEAR by the FIG and by the olive
By Mount Sinai
And by this inviolate soil
That of goodliest fabric we created man
Then brought him down to be the lowest of the low
Save who believe and do the things that are right for theirs shall be a reward that faileth not
Then who after this shall make thee treat the Judgment as a lie
What is not God the most just of judges
In the Name of God the Compassionate the Merciful
I SWEAR by the declining day
Verily man's lot is cast amid destruction
Save those who believe and do the things which be right and enjoin truth and enjoin stedfastness on each other
In the Name of God the Compassionate the Merciful
BY the star bespangled Heaven
By the promised Day
By the witness and the witnessed
Cursed the masters of the trench
Of the fuel fed fire
When they sat around it
Witnesses of what they inflicted on the believers
Nor did they torment them but for their faith in God the Mighty the Praiseworthy
His the kingdom of the Heavens and of the Earth and God is the witness of everything
Verily those who vexed the believers men and women and repented not doth the torment of Hell and the torment of the burning await
But for those who shall have believed and done the things that be right are the Gardens beneath whose shades the rivers flow 
This the immense bliss
Verily right terrible will be thy Lord's vengeance
He it is who produceth all things and causeth them to return
And is He the Indulgent the Loving
Possessor of the Glorious throne
Worker of that he willeth
Hath not the story reached thee of the hosts
Of Pharaoh and Themoud
Nay the infields are all for denial
But God surroundeth them from behind
Yet it is a glorious Koran
Written on the preserved Table
In the Name of God the Compassionate the Merciful
THE BLOW what is the Blow
Who shall teach thee what the Blow is
The Day when men shall be like scattered moths
And the mountains shall be like flocks of carded wool
Then as to him whose balances are heavy his shall be a life that shall please him well
And as to him whose balances are light his dwelling place shall be the pit
And who shall teach thee what the pit  El Hawiya  is
A raging fire
In the Name of God the Compassionate the Merciful
WHEN the Earth with her quaking shall quake
And the Earth shall cast forth her burdens
And man shall say What aileth her
On that day shall she tell out her tidings
Because thy Lord shall have inspired her
On that day shall men come forward in throngs to behold their works
And whosoever shall have wrought an atom's weight of good shall behold it
And whosoever shall have wrought an atom's weight of evil shall behold it
In the Name of God the Compassionate the Merciful
WHEN the Heaven shall CLEAVE asunder
And when the stars shall disperse
And when the seas shall be commingled
And when the graves shall be turned upside down
Each soul shall recognise its earliest and its latest actions
O man what hath misled thee against thy generous Lord
Who hath created thee and moulded thee and shaped thee aright
In the form which pleased Him hath He fashioned thee
Even so but ye treat the Judgment as a lie
Yet truly there are guardians over you 
Illustrious recorders 
Cognisant of your actions
Surely amid delights shall the righteous dwell
But verily the impure in Hell fire
They shall be burned at it on the day of doom
And they shall not be able to hide themselves from it
Who shall teach thee what the day of doom is
Once more Who shall teach thee what the day of doom is
It is a day when one soul shall be powerless for another soul all sovereignty on that day shall be with God
In the Name of God the Compassionate the Merciful
WHEN the sun shall be FOLDED UP
And when the stars shall fall
And when the mountains shall be set in motion
And when the she camels shall be abandoned
And when the wild beasts shall be gathered together
And when the seas shall boil
And when souls shall be paired with their bodies
And when the female child that had been buried alive shall be asked
For what crime she was put to death
And when the leaves of the Book shall be unrolled
And when the Heaven shall be stripped away
And when Hell shall be made to blaze
And when Paradise shall be brought near
Every soul shall know what it hath produced
It needs not that I swear by the stars of retrograde motions
Which move swiftly and hide themselves away
And by the night when it cometh darkening on
And by the dawn when it brighteneth
That this is the word of an illustrious Messenger
Endued with power having influence with the Lord of the Throne
Obeyed there by Angels faithful to his trust
And your compatriot is not one possessed by djinn
For he saw him in the clear horizon
Nor doth he grapple with heaven's secrets
Nor doth he teach the doctrine of a cursed Satan
Whither then are ye going
Verily this is no other than a warning to all creatures
To him among you who willeth to walk in a straight path
But will it ye shall not unless as God willeth it the Lord of the worlds
In the Name of God the Compassionate the Merciful
WHEN the Heaven shall have SPLIT ASUNDER
And duteously obeyed its Lord
And when Earth shall have been stretched out as a plain
And shall have cast forth what was in her and become empty
And duteously obeyed its Lord
Then verily O man who desirest to reach thy Lord shalt thou meet him
And he into whose right hand his Book shall be given
Shall be reckoned with in an easy reckoning
And shall turn rejoicing to his kindred
But he whose Book shall be given him behind his back
Shall invoke destruction
But in the fire shall he burn
For that he lived joyously among his kindred
Without a thought that he should return to God
Yea but his Lord beheld him
It needs not therefore that I swear by the sunset redness
And by the night and its gatherings
And by the moon when at her full
That from state to state shall ye be surely carried onward
What then hath come to them that they believe not
And that when the Koran is recited to them they adore not
Yea the unbelievers treat it as a lie
But God knoweth their secret hatreds
Let their only tidings be those of painful punishment
Save to those who believe and do the things that be right
An unfailing recompense shall be theirs
In the Name of God the Compassionate the Merciful
By the snorting CHARGERS
And those that dash off sparks of fire
And those that scour to the attack at morn
And stir therein the dust aloft
And cleave therein their midway through a host
Truly Man is to his Lord ungrateful
And of this he is himself a witness
And truly he is vehement in the love of this world's good
Ah knoweth he not that when that which is in the graves shall be laid bare
And that which is in men's breasts shall be brought forth
Verily their Lord shall on that day be informed concerning them
In the Name of God the Compassionate the Merciful
By those angels who DRAG FORTH souls with violence
And by those who with joyous release release them
By those who swim swimmingly along
By those who are foremost with foremost speed
By those who conduct the affairs of the universe
One day the disturbing trumpet blast shall disturb it
Which the second blast shall follow
Men's hearts on that day shall quake 
Their looks be downcast
The infidels will say Shall we indeed be restored as at first
What when we have become rotten bones
This then say they will be a return to loss
Verily it will be but a single blast
And lo they are on the surface of the earth
Hath the story of Moses reached thee
When his Lord called to him in Towa's holy vale
Go to Pharaoh for he hath burst all bounds
And say Wouldest thou become just
Then I will guide thee to thy Lord that thou mayest fear him
And he showed him a great miracle
But he treated him as an impostor and rebelled
Then turned he his back all hastily
And gathered an assembly and proclaimed
And said I am your Lord supreme
So God visited on him the punishment of this life and of the other
Verily herein is a lesson for him who hath the fear of God
Are ye the harder to create or the heaven which he hath built
He reared its height and fashioned it
And gave darkness to its night and brought out its light
And afterwards stretched forth the earth 
He brought forth from it its waters and its pastures
And set the mountains firm
For you and your cattle to enjoy
But when the grand overthrow shall come
The day when a man shall reflect on the pains that he hath taken
And Hell shall be in full view of all who are looking on
Then as for him who hath transgressed
And hath chosen this present life
Verily Hell that shall be his dwelling place
But as to him who shall have feared the majesty of his Lord and shall have refrained his soul from lust
Verily Paradise that shall be his dwelling place
They will ask thee of the Hour when will be its fixed time
But what knowledge hast thou of it
Its period is known only to thy Lord
And thou art only charged with the warning of those who fear it
On the day when they shall see it it shall seem to them as though they had not tarried in the tomb longer than its evening or its morn
In the Name of God the Compassionate the Merciful
By the train of THE SENT ones
And the swift in their swiftness
By the scatterers who scatter
And the distinguishers who distinguish
And by those that give forth the word
To excuse or warn
Verily that which ye are promised is imminent
When the stars therefore shall be blotted out
And when the heaven shall be cleft
And when the mountains shall be scattered in dust
And when the Apostles shall have a time assigned them
Until what day shall that time be deferred
To the day of severing
And who shall teach thee what the day of severing is
Woe on that day to those who charged with imposture
Have we not destroyed them of old
We will next cause those of later times to follow them
Thus deal we with the evil doers
Woe on that day to those who charged with imposture
Have we not created you of a sorry germ
Which we laid up in a secure place
Till the term decreed for birth
Such is our power and how powerful are We
Woe on that day to those who charged with imposture
Have we not made the earth to hold
The living and the dead
And placed on it the tall firm mountains and given you to drink of sweet water
Woe on that day to those who charged with imposture
Begone to that Hell which ye called a lie
Begone to the shadows that lie in triple masses
But not against the flame shall they shade or help you
The sparks which it casteth out are like towers
Like tawny camels
Woe on that day to those who charged with imposture
On that day they shall not speak
Nor shall it be permitted them to allege excuses
Woe on that day to those who charged with imposture
This is the day of severing when we will assemble you and your ancestors
If now ye have any craft try your craft on me
Woe on that day to those who charged with imposture
But the god fearing shall be placed amid shades and fountains
And fruits whatsoever they shall desire
Eat and drink with health as the meed of your toils
Thus recompense we the good
Woe on that day to those who charged with imposture
Eat ye and enjoy yourselves a little while Verily ye are doers of evil
Woe on that day to those who charged with imposture
For when it is said to them bend the knee they bend it not
Woe on that day to those who charged with imposture
In what other revelation after this will they believe
In the Name of God the Compassionate the Merciful
Of what ask they of one another
Of the great NEWS
The theme of their disputes
Nay they shall certainly knows its truth
Again Nay they shall certainly know it
Have we not made the Earth a couch
And the mountains its tent stakes
We have created you of two sexes
And ordained your sleep for rest
And ordained the night as a mantle
And ordained the day for gaining livelihood
And built above you seven solid heavens
And placed therein a burning lamp
And we send down water in abundance from the rain clouds
That we may bring forth by it corn and herbs
And gardens thick with trees
Lo the day of Severance is fixed
The day when there shall be a blast on the trumpet and ye shall come in crowds
And the heaven shall be opened and be full of portals
And the mountains shall be set in motion and melt into thin vapour
Hell truly shall be a place of snares
The home of transgressors
To abide therein ages
No coolness shall they taste therein nor any drink
Save boiling water and running sores
Meet recompense
For they looked not forward to their account
And they gave the lie to our signs charging them with falsehood
But we noted and wrote down all
Taste this then and we will give you increase of nought but torment
But for the God fearing is a blissful abode
Enclosed gardens and vineyards
And damsels with swelling breasts their peers in age
And a full cup
There shall they hear no vain discourse nor any falsehood
A recompense from thy Lord sufficing gift 
Lord of the heavens and of the earth and of all that between them lieth the God of Mercy 
But not a word shall they obtain from Him
On the day whereon the Spirit and the Angels shall be ranged in order they shall not speak save he whom the God of Mercy shall permit and who shall say that which is right
This is the sure day Whoso then will let him take the path of return to his Lord
Verily we warn you of a chastisement close at hand
The day on which a man shall see the deeds which his hands have sent before him and when the unbeliever shall say Oh would I were dust
In the Name of God the Compassionate the Merciful
Hath the tidings of the day that shall OVERSHADOW reached thee
Downcast on that day shall be the countenances of some
Travailing and worn
Burnt at the scorching fire
Made to drink from a fountain fiercely boiling
No food shall they have but the fruit of Darih
Which shall not fatten nor appease their hunger
Joyous too on that day the countenances of others
Well pleased with their labours past
In a lofty garden
No vain discourse shalt thou hear therein
Therein shall be a gushing fountain
Therein shall be raised couches
And goblets ready placed
And cushions laid in order
And carpets spread forth
Can they not look up to the clouds how they are created
And to the heaven how it is upraised
And to the mountains how they are rooted
And to the earth how it is outspread
Warn thou then for thou art a warner only
Thou hast no authority over them
But whoever shall turn back and disbelieve
God shall punish him with the greater punishment
Verily to Us shall they return
Then shall it be Our's to reckon with them
In the Name of God the Compassionate the Merciful
By the DAYBREAK and ten nights
By that which is double and that which is single
By the night when it pursues its course
Is there not in this an oath becoming a man of sense
Hast thou not seen how thy Lord dealt with Ad
At Irem adorned with pillars
Whose like have not been reared in these lands
And with Themoud who hewed out the rocks in the valley
And with Pharaoh the impaler
Who all committed excesses in the lands
And multiplied wickedness therein
Wherefore thy Lord let loose on them the scourge of chastisement
For thy Lord standeth on a watch tower
As to man when his Lord trieth him and honoureth him and is bounteous to him
Then saith he My Lord honoureth me
But when he proveth him and limiteth his gifts to him
He saith My Lord despiseth me
Aye But ye honour not the orphan
Nor urge ye one another to feed the poor
And ye devour heritages devouring greedily
And ye love riches with exceeding love
Aye But when the earth shall be crushed with crushing crushing
And thy Lord shall come and the angels rank on rank
And Hell on that day shall be moved up Man shall on that day remember himself But how shall remembrance help him
He shall say Oh would that I had prepared for this my life On that day none shall punish as God punisheth
And none shall bind with such bonds as He
Oh thou soul which art at rest
Return to thy Lord pleased and pleasing him
Enter thou among my servants
And enter thou my Paradise
In the Name of God the Compassionate the Merciful
It needeth not that I swear by the day of the RESURRECTION
Or that I swear by the self accusing soul
Thinketh man that we shall not re unite his bones
Aye his very finger tips are we able evenly to replace
But man chooseth to deny what is before him
He asketh When this day of Resurrection
But when the eye shall be dazzled
And when the moon shall be darkened
And the sun and the moon shall be together
On that day man shall cry Where is there a place to flee to
But in vain there is no refuge 
With thy Lord on that day shall be the sole asylum
On that day shall man be told of all that he hath done first and last
Yea a man shall be the eye witness against himself
And even if he put forth his plea
 Move not thy tongue in haste to follow and master this revelation
For we will see to the collecting and the recital of it
But when we have recited it then follow thou the recital
And verily afterwards it shall be ours to make it clear to thee 
Aye but ye love the transitory
And ye neglect the life to come
On that day shall faces beam with light
Outlooking towards their Lord
And faces on that day shall be dismal
As if they thought that some great calamity would befal them
Aye when the soul shall come up into the throat
And there shall be a cry Who hath a charm that can restore him
And the man feeleth that the time of his departure is come
And when one leg shall be laid over the other
To thy Lord on that day shall he be driven on
For he believed not and he did not pray
But he called the truth a lie and turned his back
Then walking with haughty men rejoined his people
That Hour is nearer to thee and nearer
It is ever nearer to thee and nearer still
Thinketh man that he shall be left supreme
Was he not a mere embryo
Then he became thick blood of which God formed him and fashioned him
And made him twain male and female
Is not He powerful enough to quicken the dead
In the Name of God the Compassionate the Merciful
Woe to those who STINT the measure
Who when they take by measure from others exact the full
But when they mete to them or weigh to them minish 
What have they no thought that they shall be raised again
For the great day
The day when mankind shall stand before the Lord of the worlds
Yes the register of the wicked is in Sidjin
And who shall make thee understand what Sidjin is
It is a book distinctly written
Woe on that day to those who treated our signs as lies
Who treated the day of judgment as a lie
None treat it as a lie save the transgressor the criminal
Who when our signs are rehearsed to him saith Tales of the Ancients
Yes but their own works have got the mastery over their hearts
Yes they shall be shut out as by a veil from their Lord on that day
Then shall they be burned in Hell fire
Then shall it be said to them This is what ye deemed a lie
Even so But the register of the righteous is in Illiyoun
And who shall make thee understand what Illiyoun is
A book distinctly written
The angels who draw nigh unto God attest it
Surely among delights shall the righteous dwell
Seated on bridal couches they will gaze around
Thou shalt mark in their faces the brightness of delight
Choice sealed wine shall be given them to quaff
The seal of musk For this let those pant who pant for bliss 
Mingled therewith shall be the waters of Tasnim 
Fount whereof they who draw nigh to God shall drink
The sinners indeed laugh the faithful to scorn
And when they pass by them they wink at one another 
And when they return to their own people they return jesting
And when they see them they say These are the erring ones
And yet they have no mission to be their guardians
Therefore on that day the faithful shall laugh the infidels to scorn
As reclining on bridal couches they behold them
Shall not the infidels be recompensed according to their works
In the Name of God the Compassionate the Merciful
The INEVITABLE
And who shall make thee comprehend what the Inevitable is
Themoud and Ad treated the day of Terrors as a lie
So as to Themoud they were destroyed by crashing thunder bolts
And as to Ad they were destroyed by a roaring and furious blast
It did the bidding of God against them seven nights and eight days together during which thou mightest have seen the people laid low as though they had been the trunks of hollow palms
And couldst thou have seen one of them surviving
Pharaoh also and those who flourished before him and the overthrown cities committed sin
And disobeyed the Sent one of their Lord therefore did he chastise them with an accumulated chastisement
When the Flood rose high we bare you in the Ark
That we might make that event a warning to you and that the retaining ear might retain it
But when one blast shall be blown on the trumpet
And the earth and the mountains shall be upheaved and shall both be crushed into dust at a single crushing
On that day the woe that must come suddenly shall suddenly come
And the heaven shall cleave asunder for on that day it shall be fragile
And the angels shall be on its sides and over them on that day eight shall bear up the throne of thy Lord
On that day ye shall be brought before Him none of your hidden deeds shall remain hidden
And he who shall have his book given to him in his right hand will say to his friends Take ye it read ye my book
I ever thought that to this my reckoning I should come
And his shall be a life that shall please him well
In a lofty garden
Whose clusters shall be near at hand
Eat ye and drink with healthy relish as the meed of what ye sent on beforehand in the days which are past
But he who shall have his book given into his left hand will say O that my book had never been given me
And that I had never known my reckoning
O that death had made an end of me
My wealth hath not profited me
My power hath perished from me
Lay ye hold on him and chain him
Then at the Hell fire burn him
Then into a chain whose length is seventy cubits thrust him
For he believed not in God the Great
And was not careful to feed the poor
No friend therefore shall he have here this day
Nor food but corrupt sores
Which none shall eat but the sinners
It needs not that I swear by what ye see
And by that which ye see not
That this verily is the word of an apostle worthy of all honour
And that it is not the word of a poet how little do ye believe
Neither is it the word of a soothsayer  Kahin  how little do ye receive warning
It is a missive from the Lord of the worlds
But if Muhammad had fabricated concerning us any sayings
We had surely seized him by the right hand
And had cut through the vein of his neck
Nor would We have withheld any one of you from him
But verily It  the Koran  is a warning for the God fearing
And we well know that there are of you who treat it as a falsehood
But it shall be the despair of infidels
For it is the very truth of sure knowledge
Praise then the name of thy Lord the Great
In the Name of God the Compassionate the Merciful
By the clouds which scatter with SCATTERING
And those which bear their load
And by those which speed lightly along
And those which apportion by command
True indeed is that with which ye are threatened
And lo the judgment will surely come
By the star tracked heaven
Ye are discordant in what ye say
But whose turneth him from the truth is turned from it by a divine decree
Perish the liars
Who are bewildered in the depths of ignorance
They ask When this day of judgment
On that day they shall be tormented at the fire
Taste ye of this your torment whose speedy coming ye challenged
But the God fearing shall dwell amid gardens and fountains
Enjoying what their Lord hath given them because aforetime they were well doers
But little of the night was it that they slept
And at dawn they prayed for pardon
And gave due share of their wealth to the suppliant and the outcast
On Earth are signs for men of firm belief
And also in your own selves Will ye not then behold them
The Heaven hath sustenance for you and it containeth that which you are promised
By the Lord then of the heaven and of the earth I swear that this is the truth even as ye speak yourselves
Hath the story reached thee of Abraham's honoured guests
When they went in unto him and said Peace he replied Peace they are strangers
And he went apart to his family and brought a fatted calf
And set it before them He said Eat ye not
And he conceived a fear of them They said to him Fear not and announced to him a wise son
His wife came up with outcry she smote her face and said What I old and barren
They said Thus saith thy Lord He truly is the Wise the Knowing
Said he And what O messengers is your errand
They said To a wicked people are we sent
To hurl upon them stones of clay
Destined by thy Lord for men guilty of excesses
And we brought forth the believers who were in the city
But we found not in it but one family of Muslims
And signs we left in it for those who dread the afflictive chastisement 
And in Moses when we sent him to Pharaoh with manifest power
But relying on his forces he turned his back and said Sorcerer or Possessed
So we seized him and his hosts and cast them into the sea for of all blame was he worthy
And in Ad when we sent against them the desolating blast
It touched not aught over which it came but it turned it to dust
And in Themoud when it was said to them Enjoy yourselves for yet a while
But they rebelled against their Lord's command so the tempest took them as they watched its coming
They were not able to stand upright and could not help themselves
And we destroyed the people of Noah before them for an impious people were they
And the Heaven with our hands have we built it up and given it its expanse
And the Earth we have stretched it out like a carpet and how smoothly have we spread it forth
And of everything have we created pairs that haply ye may reflect
Fly then to God I come to you from him a plain warner
And set not up another god with God I come to you from him a plain warner
Even thus came there no apostle to those who flourished before them but they exclaimed Sorcerer or Possessed
Have they made a legacy to one another of this scoff Yes they are a rebel people
Turn away then from them and thou shalt not incur reproach
Yet warn them for in truth warning will profit the believers
I have not created Djinn and men but that they should worship me
I require not sustenance from them neither require I that they feed me
Verily God is the sole sustainer possessed of might the unshaken
Therefore to those who injure thee shall be a fate like the fate of
their fellows of old Let them not challenge me to hasten it
Woe then to the infidels because of their threatened day
In the Name of God the Compassionate the Merciful
BY the MOUNTAIN
And by the Book written
On an outspread roll
And by the frequented fane
And by the lofty vault
And by the swollen sea
Verily a chastisement from thy Lord is imminent
And none shall put it back
Reeling on that day the Heaven shall reel
And stirring shall the mountains stir
And woe on that day to those who called the apostles liars
Who plunged for pastime into vain disputes
On that day shall they be thrust with thrusting to the fire of Hell
This is the fire which ye treated as a lie
What is this magic then or do ye not see it
Burn ye therein bear it patiently or impatiently 'twill be the same to you for ye shall assuredly receive the reward of your doings
But mid gardens and delights shall they dwell who have feared God
Rejoicing in what their Lord hath given them and that from the pain of hell fire hath their Lord preserved them
Eat and drink with healthy enjoyment in recompense for your deeds
On couches ranged in rows shall they recline and to the damsels with large dark eyes will we wed them
And to those who have believed whose offspring have followed them in the faith will we again unite their offspring nor of the meed of their works will we in the least defraud them 
Pledged to God is every man for his actions and their desert
And fruits in abundance will we give them and flesh as they shall desire
Therein shall they pass to one another the cup which shall engender no light discourse no motive to sin
And youths shall go round among them beautiful as imbedded pearls
And shall accost one another and ask mutual questions
A time indeed there was will they say when we were full of care as to the future lot of our families
But kind hath God been to us and from the pestilential torment hath he preserved us
For heretofore we called upon Him and He is the Beneficent the Merciful
Warn thou then For thou by the favour of thy Lord art neither soothsayer nor possessed
Will they say A poet let us await some adverse turn of his fortune
SAY wait ye and in sooth I too will wait with you
Is it their dreams which inspire them with this or is it that they are a perverse people
Will they say He hath forged it  the Koran  himself 
Nay rather it is that they believed not
Let them then produce a discourse like it if they speak the Truth
Were they created by nothing or were they the creators of themselves
Created they the Heavens and Earth Nay rather they have no faith
Hold they thy Lord's treasures Bear they the rule supreme
Have they a ladder for hearing the angels Let any one who hath heard them bring a clear proof of it
Hath God daughters and ye sons
Asketh thou pay of them they are themselves weighed down with debts
Have they such a knowledge of the secret things that they can write them down
Desire they to lay snares for thee But the snared ones shall be they who do not believe
Have they any God beside God Glory be to God above what they join with Him
And should they see a fragment of the heaven falling down they would say It is only a dense cloud
Leave them then until they come face to face with the day when they shall swoon away
A day in which their snares shall not at all avail them neither shall they be helped
And verily beside this is there a punishment for the evildoers but most of them know it not
Wait thou patiently the judgment of thy Lord for thou art in our eye and celebrate the praise of thy Lord when thou risest up
And in the night season Praise him when the stars are setting
In the name of God the Compassionate the Merciful
WHEN the day that must come shall have come suddenly
None shall treat that sudden coming as a lie
Day that shall abase Day that shall exalt
When the earth shall be shaken with a shock
And the mountains shall be crumbled with a crumbling
And shall become scattered dust
And into three bands shall ye be divided
Then the people of the right hand Oh how happy shall be the people of the right hand
And the people of the left hand Oh how wretched shall be the people of the left hand
And they who were foremost on earth the foremost still
These are they who shall be brought nigh to God
In gardens of delight
A crowd of the former
And few of the latter generations
On inwrought couches
Reclining on them face to face
Aye blooming youths go round about to them
With goblets and ewers and a cup of flowing wine
Their brows ache not from it nor fails the sense
And with such fruits as shall please them best
And with flesh of such birds as they shall long for
And theirs shall be the Houris with large dark eyes like pearls hidden in their shells
In recompense of their labours past
No vain discourse shall they hear therein nor charge of sin
But only the cry Peace Peace
And the people of the right hand oh how happy shall be the people of the right hand
Amid thornless sidrahs
And talh trees clad with fruit
And in extended shade
And by flowing waters
And with abundant fruits
Unfailing unforbidden
And on lofty couches
Of a rare creation have we created the Houris
And we have made them ever virgins
Dear to their spouses of equal age with them
For the people of the right hand
A crowd of the former
And a crowd of the latter generations
But the people of the left hand oh how wretched shall be the people of the left hand
Amid pestilential winds and in scalding water
And in the shadow of a black smoke
Not cool and horrid to behold
For they truly ere this were blessed with worldly goods
But persisted in heinous sin
And were wont to say
What after we have died and become dust and bones shall we be raised
And our fathers the men of yore
SAY Aye the former and the latter
Gathered shall they all be for the time of a known day
Then ye O ye the erring the gainsaying
Shall surely eat of the tree Ez zakkoum
And fill your bellies with it
And thereupon shall ye drink boiling water
And ye shall drink as the thirsty camel drinketh
This shall be their repast in the day of reckoning
We created you will ye not credit us
What think ye The germs of life 
Is it ye who create them or are we their creator
It is we who have decreed that death should be among you
Yet are we not thereby hindered from replacing you with others your likes or from producing you again in a form which ye know not
Ye have known the first creation will ye not then reflect
What think ye That which ye sow 
Is it ye who cause its upgrowth or do we cause it to spring forth
If we pleased we could so make your harvest dry and brittle that ye would ever marvel and say
Truly we have been at cost yet are we forbidden harvest
What think ye of the water ye drink
Is it ye who send it down from the clouds or send we it down
Brackish could we make it if we pleased will ye not then be thankful
What think ye The fire which ye obtain by friction 
Is it ye who rear its tree or do we rear it
It is we who have made it for a memorial and a benefit to the wayfarers of the desert
Praise therefore the name of thy Lord the Great
It needs not that I swear by the setting of the stars
And it is a great oath if ye knew it
That this is the honourable Koran
Written in the preserved Book
Let none touch it but the purified
It is a revelation from the Lord of the worlds
Such tidings as these will ye disdain
Will ye make it your daily bread to gainsay them
Why at the moment when the soul of a dying man shall come up into his throat
And when ye are gazing at him
Though we are nearer to him than ye although ye see us not
Why do ye not if ye are to escape the judgment
Cause that soul to return Tell me if ye speak the truth
But as to him who shall enjoy near access to God
His shall be repose and pleasure and a garden of delights
Yea for him who shall be of the people of the right hand
Shall be the greeting from the people of the right handPeace be to thee
But for him who shall be of those who treat the prophets as deceivers
And of the erring
His entertainment shall be of scalding water
And the broiling of hell fire
Verily this is a certain truth
Praise therefore the name of thy Lord the Great
In the Name of God the Compassionate the Merciful
By the STAR when it setteth
Your compatriot erreth not nor is he led astray
Neither speaketh he from mere impulse
The Koran is no other than a revelation revealed to him
One terrible in power taught it him
Endued with wisdom With even balance stood he
In the highest part of the horizon
Then came he nearer and approached
And was at the distance of two bows or even closer
And he revealed to his servant what he revealed
His heart falsified not what he saw
What will ye then dispute with him as to what he saw
He had seen him also another time
Near the Sidrah tree which marks the boundary
Near which is the garden of repose
When the Sidrah tree was covered with what covered it
His eye turned not aside nor did it wander
For he saw the greatest of the signs of his Lord
Do you see Al Lat and Al Ozza
And Manat the third idol besides
What shall ye have male progeny and God female
This were indeed an unfair partition
These are mere names ye and your fathers named them thus God hath not sent down any warranty in their regard A mere conceit and their own impulses do they follow 
Yet hath the guidance from their Lord come to them
Shall man have whatever he wisheth
The future and the present are in the hand of God
And many as are the Angels in the Heavens their intercession shall be of no avail
Until God hath permitted it to whom he shall please and will accept
Verily it is they who believe not in the life to come who name the angels with names of females
But herein they have no knowledge they follow a mere conceit and mere conceit can never take the place of truth
Withdraw then from him who turneth his back on our warning and desireth only this present life
This is the sum of their knowledge Truly thy Lord best knoweth him who erreth from his way and He best knoweth him who hath received guidance
And whatever is in the Heavens and in the Earth is God's that he may reward those who do evil according to their deeds and those who do good will He reward with good things
To those who avoid great crimes and scandals but commit only lighter faults verily thy Lord will be diffuse of mercy 
He well knew you when he produced you out of the earth and when ye were embryos in your mother's womb 
Assert not then your own purity He best knoweth who feareth him
Hast thou considered him who turned his back
Who giveth little and is covetous
Is it that he hath the knowledge and vision of the secret things
Hath he not been told of what is in the pages of Moses
And of Abraham faithful to his pledge
That no burdened soul shall bear the burdens of another
And that nothing shall be reckoned to a man but that for which he hath made efforts
And that his efforts shall at last be seen in their true light
That then he shall be recompensed with a most exact recompense
And that unto thy Lord is the term of all things
And that it is He who causeth to laugh and to weep
And that He causeth to die and maketh alive
And that He hath created the sexes male and female
From the diffused germs of life
And that with Him is the second creation
And that He enricheth and causeth to possess
And that He is the Lord of Sirius
And that it was He who destroyed the ancient Adites
And the people of Themoud and left not one survivor
And before them the people of Noah who were most wicked and most perverse
And it was He who destroyed the cities that were overthrown
So that that which covered them covered them
Which then of thy Lord's benefits wilt thou make a matter of doubt
He who warneth you is one of the warners of old
The day that must draw nigh draweth nigh already and yet none but God can reveal its time
Is it at these sayings that ye marvel
And that ye laugh and weep not
And that ye are triflers
Prostrate yourselves then to God and worship
